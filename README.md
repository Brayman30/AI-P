## OK, but what's it really

It's a simple shell script which installs many things, including the following:

 - Nano
 - Firefox
 - VSCodium (An Open source version of vsCode)
 - Discord
 - GParted
 - GIMP
 - Thunar
 - Python
 - qBittorent
 - Timeshift
 - rclone
## How do I use it?
Simple*...
Open a terminal window and type 

    git clone https://github.com/Brayman30/AI-P.git

Now, type 

    cd AI-P

Now... Here's where things get a **little *messy***, 
depending on which of distribution you are using, the commands are a *little different* but, no big deal, files have already been created for Debian, Arch, Red Hat, & OpenSUSE (Hint: if you don't know what you are using, or you are using Ubuntu or one of it's derivitives, your using Debian. If you are using manjoro, you are using Arch, so be smug about it ðŸ˜‰ )
#### The following commands will apply to each of those OS:
|Distro|Command|
|--|--|
|Debian|`bash Debian-AI-P.sh`|
|Arch|`bash Arch-AI-P.sh`|
|Red Hat|`bash REL-AI-P.sh`|
|OpenSUSE|`bash SUSE-AI-P.sh`|

Once you start the script, you will be asked for your password either by a fancy GUI (if you have zenity installed) or by a sudo prompt

###*
####You will need to have /bin/bash and git installed but most distributions have that by default.

####Also, note for arch, you will need DNF to run this... If you have complanints please write to `222 Do Not Care road Providence, Rohde Island`
