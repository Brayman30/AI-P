## OK, but what's it really

It's a simple shell script which installs many things, including the following:

 - Nano
 - Firefox
 - VSCodium (An Open source version of vsCode)
 - Discord
 - GParted
 - GIMP
 - Thunar
 - Python
 - qBittorent
 - Timeshift
## How do I use it?
Simple*...
Open a terminal window and type 

    git clone https://github.com/Brayman30/AI-P.git

Now, type 

    cd AI-P

Now... Here's where things get a **little *messy***, 
depending on which of distribution you are using, the commands are a *little different* but, no big deal, files have already been created for Debian, Arch, Red Hat, & OpenSUSE (Hint: if you don't know what you are using, your probably using Debian.)
#### The following commands will apply to each of those OS:
|Distro|Command|
|--|--|
|Debian|`bash Debian-AI-P.sh`|
|Arch|`bash Arch-AI-P.sh`|
|Red Hat|`bash REL-AI-P.sh`|
|OpenSUSE|`bash SUSE-AI-P.sh`|

Once you start the script, you will be asked for your password either by a fancy GUI (if you have zenity installed) or by a sudo prompt
